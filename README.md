# Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic Dynamics and Socio-Economic Impacts Using WHO and WDI Data
## Project Overview
### Summary
Analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across several countries using WHO data and examined the socio-economic impacts using World Bank Development Indicators. Implemented data smoothing, correlation analysis, and PCA to uncover trends and insights, focusing on the differential impacts on various countries and the relationship between health metrics and socio-economic indicators.

### Data

Two data sets are provided in the repository:

1. Daily numbers of new cases of COVID-19 and new COVID-19 related deaths in most countries in the world as collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) on a daily basis. The data is from 2022-09-30. 
2. World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) with some socio-economic indicators as provided for most countries in the world. 

### Key Skills and Techniques
- Data Analysis

- Data Visualization

- Statistical Analysis

- Correlation Analysis

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Time Series Analysis
  
### Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Aggregated daily COVID-19 cases and deaths from WHO and socio-economic indicators from WDI.

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and ensured data consistency for reliable analysis.

- **Data Smoothing:** Applied smoothing techniques to highlight trends and reduce noise in COVID-19 case data.

- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigated correlations between COVID-19 metrics and socio-economic indicators.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Conducted PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify key patterns in the socio-economic data.

- **Visualization:** Created informative graphs and plots to illustrate key findings.
  
### Key Findings and Insights
- Identified the peak and decline periods of COVID-19 waves in various countries.

- Demonstrated how different smoothing windows affect the interpretation of COVID-19 trends.

- Revealed the evolving relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

- Highlighted significant socio-economic correlations, such as the relationship between physician density and life expectancy.

- Showed how PCA can distinguish between countries based on socio-economic characteristics.

### Visuals and Figures
- Time series plots of COVID-19 cases and deaths with different smoothing windows.

- Correlation matrices illustrating relationships between socio-economic indicators.

- PCA plots showing country clusters based on socio-economic metrics.

### Impact
- Provided insights into the effectiveness of public health interventions across different countries.

- Highlighted the importance of healthcare infrastructure in mitigating pandemic impacts.

- Informed policy decisions by demonstrating socio-economic factors influencing health outcomes.
